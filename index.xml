      <title>A brief Introduction to DOT language</title>

      <description>Free from the Restrictions I have been quite obsessed with fancy tools and techniques. Before I met DOT, I have tried many tools to reorganize my thought. Such as Visio, Grapholite, SimpleMind, Xmind, MindNode, iMindMap barabara, such a long list. Each software has its own charming features as well as some minor restrictions. But what&amp;rsquo;s annoying most for a perfectionist is to finetune the layout and format. DOT actually gives you the opportunity to free yourself from those trivial matters, what you need to do is just focus on your own thinking and leave the rest to DOT.</description>

      <description>Say hi, say bye!
Say goodbye to yesterday low-efficiency and embrace a brand-new, productive lifestyle.
Cliche as always. I don&amp;rsquo;t recall how many blogs I have created before. But I&amp;rsquo;m sure this blog will be well maintained as long as I&amp;rsquo;m able to write. Consider this article as the debut of &amp;lsquo;I do&amp;rsquo; new episode, as well as the end of &amp;lsquo;Hello World&amp;rsquo; storyline.</description>
