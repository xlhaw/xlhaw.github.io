      <description>Free from the Restrictions I have been quite obsessed with fancy tools and techniques. Before I met DOT, I have tried many tools to reorganize my thought. Such as Visio, Grapholite, SimpleMind, Xmind, MindNode, iMindMap barabara, such a long list. Each software has its own charming features as well as some minor restrictions. But what&amp;rsquo;s annoying most for a perfectionist is to finetune the layout and format. DOT actually gives you the opportunity to free yourself from those trivial matters, what you need to do is just focus on your own thinking and leave the rest to DOT.</description>
