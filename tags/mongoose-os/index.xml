      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve got my hands on the craved-for IoT ESP32, thanks to DFRobot, and have been tinkering with it ever since. I&amp;rsquo;m really amazed by it since it packs both Bluetooth and WiFi in a small yet powerful unit. Since I received the MCU rather than the module, so, to use it, I made myself a breakout board named ESPer(because, why not? ðŸ˜„). Feel free to check out its Instructable over here.</description>
