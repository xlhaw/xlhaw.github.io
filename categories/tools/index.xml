      <description>Free from the Restrictions I have been quite obesssed with fancy tools and techniques. Before I met DOT, I have tried many tools to reorganize my thought. Such as Visio,Grapholite,SimpleMind, Xmind, MindNode, iMindMap barabara, such a long list. Each software has its own charming features as well as some minor restrictions. But what&amp;rsquo;s annoying most for a perfectionist is to finetune the layout and format. DOT actually gives you the oppotunity to free yourself from those trival matters, what you neeed to do is just focus on your own thinking and leave the rest to DOT.</description>
