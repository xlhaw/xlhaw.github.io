Before I encounter with DOT, I have tried many tools to reorganize my thought. Such as Visio,Grapholite,SimpleMind, Xmind, MindNode, iMindMap barabara, such a long list.

Say goodbye to yesterday low-efficiency and embrace a brand-new, productive lifestyle. Cliche as always. I don’t recall how much blogs I have created before.But I’m sure this blog will last as long as I’m able to write. Consider this article as the debut of ‘I do’ series, as well as the end of ‘Hello World’ series. Criteria Forget about yourself, don’t critize and judge your past. Be nice to every person in your life and be gratefull. Don’t haste to the result,yet take your time in your mind. Accept imperfection, as rome isn’t built in a day, but you have to take action now.
